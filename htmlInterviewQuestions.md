* Markup language applies layout and formatting conventions to a text document which makes the text more interactive and dynamic.  It includes animations, audio, images and text, amoung many other things;
* A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser.  A web page can be identified by entering a URL (Uniform Resource Locator);
* An HTML document is made of many different HTML tags, each of which contains different content.  The HTML tags format the content for proper display on web pages;

## Is an HTML tag and element the same thing?  What are they?
* Tags are pieces of HTML code used to define the structure of an HTML page;
* Content is placed in between HTML tags in order to properly format it;

        <!-- image tag -->
        <img> 
        <!-- line break tag -->
        <br> /* - tag */
    ```
* HTML elements are defined by a starting tag, may contain some content and a closing tag;  
* For example:
    ```html
        <!-- an example of an html element -->
        <h1>Heading 1</h> 

        <!-- by itself: a starting tag -->
        <h1>

        <!-- by itself: a closing tag -->
        </h1>
    ```
